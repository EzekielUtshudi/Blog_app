# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: "Star Wars" }, { name: "Lord of the Rings" }])
#   Character.create(name: "Luke", movie: movies.first)

# User.create(name: "Tobin", photo: "www.google.com", bio: "I am a developer", posts_counter: 0)
# User.create(name: "Nemwel", photo: "www.google.com", bio: "I am a developer", posts_counter: 0)
# Post.create(author_id: 1, title: "Hello World", text: "I am a developer", comments_counter: 0, like_counter: 0)
# Post.create(author_id: 1, title: "Salam World", text: "I am a frontend developer", comments_counter: 0, like_counter: 0)
